# LumberjackTL
**For Minecraft 1.12** and friends.
More realistic destruction of trees in Minecraft.

This is a Bukkit/Spigot plugin. To install, download the LumberjackTL.jar file and drag it into your server's `plugins` directory.

All logs of a tree will be destroyed only if:
+ The highest log has leaves directly touching one of it's faces
+ the lowest log has dirt directly below it
